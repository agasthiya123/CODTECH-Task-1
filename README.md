**Objective:**

The objective of this task is to integrate a public API and visualize the retrieved data using Python. By connecting to the OpenWeatherMap API, the project fetches real-time weather forecast data for a selected city, processes the response, and presents it in a structured format. The data is then analyzed and visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn to generate meaningful insights such as temperature trends.

This project demonstrates skills in API integration, data handling, and data visualization, which are essential in real-world data-driven applications.

**Key Activities:**

**.** Integrated OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather forecast data.

**.** Processed and structured API response into a readable pandas DataFrame.

**.** Created data visualizations using Matplotlib/Seaborn (temperature trends over time).

**.** Exported graphs as images for reporting and analysis.

**.** Documented the complete workflow in a Google Colab Notebook.

**Technologies Used:**

**.** **Python** – Core programming language for data fetching and visualization

**.**  **Google Colab** – Development environment for writing and running code

**.** **OpenWeatherMap API** – Public API used for fetching real-time weather data

**.** **Pandas** – For data manipulation and tabular representation

**.** **Matplotlib** – For creating temperature trend plots and visualizations

**.**  **Seaborn** – For enhanced and styled data visualizations

**.** **GitHub** – For version control and project hosting
